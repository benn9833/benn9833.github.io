title: Test post and what to expect
date: 2024-09-28

I'm hoping to start a weekly series where I write about things I've learned that week. Hopefully, this series can help me be more accountable. I'll most likely start posting regularly after the middle of October.

I'll be sure to set a Google calendar reminder to remind me. I mainly wanted this post to be a test of my html/css setup.

Some things you can expect to see in the weekly series are:
- R
- python
- c++

And as a small amount of content, I'm on a 42-key [Piantor Pro](https://shop.beekeeb.com/product/pre-soldered-piantor-split-keyboard/). My keyboard layout shown below:
