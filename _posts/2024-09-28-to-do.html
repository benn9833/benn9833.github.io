title: Test post and what to expect

<p>I'm hoping to start a weekly series where I write about things I've learned that week. Hopefully, this series can help me be more accountable. I'll most likely start posting regularly after the middle of October.</p>

<p>I'll be sure to set a Google calendar reminder to remind me. I mainly wanted this post to be a test of my html/css setup.</p>

<p>Some things you can expect to see in the weekly series are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>R</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>C++</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>And as a small amount of content, I'm on a 42-key <a href="https://shop.beekeeb.com/product/pre-soldered-piantor-split-keyboard/">Piantor Pro</a>. My keyboard layout shown below:</p>
