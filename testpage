As a Man Thinketh (http://www.amazon.com/As-Man-Thinketh-James-Allen/dp/078583351X/) was written by James Allen (1864 - 1912) 
and first published in 1903. This book, which is more like a pamphlet in size, definitely gives you bang for your buck. Each
page has great advice on how to have better character and a more focused life.

The reason I come back to this book regularly is because it helps me re-evaluate how I spend my mental time and motivates 
me to be more efficient and focused. And while the book encompasses more than that, I will just share five excerpts that I 
found valuable. Indeed, there are many more pieces of golden wisdom in the book, but I'll leave that for you to find.

"A man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart, and set out to accomplish it. He should make this purpose the 
centralizing point of his thoughts."

"He should make this purpose [a set goal] his supreme duty, and should devote himself to its attainment, not allowing his 
thoughts to wander away into ephemeral fancies, longings, and imaginings."

"Thought allied fearlessly to purpose becomes creative force: ..."
"All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts."

"He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little; he who would achieve much must sacrifice much; he who would attain 
highly must sacrifice greatly."

I again, highly recommend that you read this book.
